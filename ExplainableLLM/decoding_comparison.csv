"Andy,  Just finished meeting with Nelson from gas fundies and Martin Lim from power fundies to discuss getting the Exotica libraries migrated ASAP.
The best I can get from them is ""hopefully tomorrow"" as far as a date for migration.
They are dealing with the validation of calculation routines between the UBS libraries and the Exotica libraries since Exotica will play a role in pnl calculation.
I will follow up on this again tomorrow.
I told them that ""hopefully tomorrow"" was not the answer I was looking for so I would help out in any way.
They recognize that we need these libraries loaded on our machines regardless of their validation.
Also, Nelson showed me a list of the products that are scheduled for 'day 1' and power options are not on that list.
There are a lot of people working with that list to prioritize support so this is just a heads up for you.
Later.

"Savita  In our testing we have found the inability to manage our wing-strikes risk.
The way it works for power markets is that most traders would be unwillling to trade more than 250MW of a wing strike without widening out the bid offer.
Similarly the risk at some point can get high enough to suspend wing strikes.
In the current option manager, the only possibility is to increase or decrease the ATM suite vol (which has little effect on the wing strikes anyway).
For that reason we need a volumetric control for each strike.
The volumeteric control could be a toggle which could be turned on or off.
If the volumetric control toggle si on, corresponding to each strike, there would be  a maximum volume.
If  the strike is hit or lifted by that volume, that strike is automatically suspended and the trader notified.
This allows the individual strike risk to be limited.
This also allows us to put some less liquid markets out there - where the price discovery is evolving.
In those products we can put the volume to be limited at 100 MW for each strike making the risk more manageable.
Pls give me a call, so that we can discuss this further.

"Hi John,       As per our conversation last week, I just wanted to double check on a potential raise before the deal closes on Friday.
I know that more than a few non-promotional raises have been offered and accepted for the transfer to UBS, and I'd like to make absolutely sure that I'm not eligible for one.
As Cowan says, potentially the bonus pool may be much bigger next year, which is great, but it's not for sure.
And given the promises Enron has dolled out over the years, it doesn't mean that much right now, especially considering it's in UBS's best interest for us not to make a killing in the first year in order to buy out the company at a lower price.
Thanks,

"John,  Further to the voice message that I left you, I have recalculated the amount of security that would be required if all of the modified direct sales contracts are acknowledged by noon January 4.
The calculations are still a bit rough but I thought this spreadsheet would provide you with something to review.
I have used a $35 Pool Price in the calculations.
Note the additional tabs in the spreadsheet that detail the hourly generation that the Pool has received for SD3 and SD4 .
In determining the actual security required, we will need to review the megawatts in the contracts registered in detail once we have the acknowledgements tomorrow.
For simplicity I have assumed that everything is base load and I know this is not correct.
Once we know exactly what contracts we are looking at, we can fine tune the calculation.
